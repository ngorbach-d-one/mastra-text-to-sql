npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.

## Usage

1. **Ask Questions**: Type a natural language question about city populations in the search box
2. **View Results**: See the generated SQL query and the results in a formatted table
3. **View Database**: Click on "View Database" in the header to see all city population data
4. **Try Examples**: Click on any example query to see how it works

## Database Schema

The application uses a `cities` table with the following structure:

- `id`: Unique identifier (hidden from view)
- `city`: City name
- `country`: Country name
- `continent`: Continent name
- `population`: Population count
- Additional demographic information

## Connection Pooling

The application uses connection pooling for efficient database access, with the following configuration:

- Maximum connections: 20
- Idle timeout: 30 seconds
- Connection timeout: 2 seconds

## Deployment

This application can be deployed on any platform that supports Next.js applications, such as Vercel or Netlify. Make sure to set up the environment variables in your deployment platform.
